Programming assignment for course DAT055, Chalmers University of Technology.

## Building ##

To build the project, run `$ ./make.sh build`. The compiled program will be put
in the `target/main` directory. Use `$ ./make.sh run` to run it.

Documentation can be build using `$ ./make.sh doc`, and end up in `target/doc`.
Source files can be linted using
*[checkstyle](http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/)* with `$ ./make.sh lint`. To
remove any built artifacts, use `$ ./make.sh clean` (not yet implemented).

Note that the build command does not have to be run from the project root, and
that arguments may be combined, for example: `$ ../make.sh lint build run`. In
this form, the arguments will run in sequence, and abort on failure.
